This project focuses on developing a Personal Fitness Tracker, a machine learning-based application that predicts calories burned during physical activity. The model utilizes datasets containing exercise parameters such as Age, Gender, BMI, Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature to estimate calorie expenditure.
The methodology involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The Random Forest Regression model has been deployed using the Streamlit framework to provide real-time predictions.
The results indicate that the model achieves satisfactory performance with minimal error. The application provides users with insightful health data, making it a valuable tool for fitness tracking.
